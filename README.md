# DEPRECATION WARNING

Starting in [hyperglass](https://github.com/checktheroads/hyperglass) v1.0.0-beta.76, hyperglass-agent is in the process of being deprecated. Moving forward, FRR & BIRD can be interacted with in the same manner as any other device â€” via SSH. See [here](https://hyperglass.io/docs/platforms#caveats) for details/caveats. Everything in hyperglass-agent will still work as-is for now, but I'd encourage users to try moving to the new transport method.
